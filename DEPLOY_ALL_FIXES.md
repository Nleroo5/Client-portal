# Deploy All Fixes - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ All fixes ready for deployment

---

## Summary of All Changes

### 1. ✅ DPA Box Golden Styling
**Files:** `index-contract.html`

Changed Data Processing Agreement box to match Service Agreement golden styling.

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Firestore Permission Error
**Files:** `firestore.rules`

Added missing fields to allow client updates:
- `websiteDirectAccess`
- `websiteAdminContact`

**Fixes error:** "Missing or insufficient permissions" when submitting website access

---

### 3. ✅ Disabled Autocomplete on Website Access Fields
**Files:** `index-contract.html`, `index-m2m.html`

**Problem:** Browser was auto-filling Admin Username and Admin Password fields from previous submissions

**Solution:** Changed form autocomplete settings:
- Form: `autocomplete="on"` → `autocomplete="off"`
- All fields: `autocomplete="username|current-password|url"` → `autocomplete="off"`
- Field names: Changed to unique names to prevent browser matching:
  - `name="username"` → `name="website-admin-username"`
  - `name="password"` → `name="website-admin-password"`

**Result:** Fields now start completely blank - clients must manually enter their website credentials

---

## Files Modified

1. **firestore.rules** - Permission fix
2. **index-contract.html** - DPA styling + autocomplete fix

## Important Notes

### Why Fields Were Auto-filling

The issue was caused by HTML5 autocomplete attributes:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (caused autofill) -->
<input type="text" name="username" autocomplete="username">
<input type="password" name="password" autocomplete="current-password">
```

Browsers saw these standard autocomplete values and filled them from:
1. Previously submitted forms on the same site
2. Password manager databases
3. Browser's saved credentials

### The Fix

```html
<!-- AFTER (prevents autofill) -->
<input type="text" name="website-admin-username" autocomplete="off">
<input type="password" name="website-admin-password" autocomplete="off">
```

By using:
- `autocomplete="off"` - Tells browser not to autofill
- Unique field names - Prevents browser from matching to saved credentials
